# Numerical Analysis functions
 MATLAB functions and accompanying examples for miscellaneous numerical analysis algorithms, made as part of a numerical methods class.
 
 * bisection.m: Finds the root of a function, given upper and lower bounds between which to find that root.
 * centerdiff_2ndderiv.m: Uses the centered difference for solving Poisson's equation.
 * chebyshev_nodes.m: Creates an array of Chebyshev nodes between two points, used for improving results of interpolation.
 * fixed_point_iteration.m: Finds a fixed point of an input function near a given value, assuming the function is continuous near that value.
 * lagrange_interpolation.m: Interpolates a function using Lagrange polynomials, given a range of sample points on that function.
 * linear_spline.m: Interpolates a function using linear splines, given a range of sample points on that function.
